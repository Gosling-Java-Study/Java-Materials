## 📚 How to Use This Site

### Navigation

Use the **sidebar** on the left to browse topics. Materials are organized by difficulty:

1. Start with **Java Basics** if you're new to programming
2. Move to **Object-Oriented Programming** once you're comfortable with the fundamentals
3. Explore **Data Structures** and **Exception Handling** to build real-world skills
4. Tackle **Advanced Topics** when you're ready for more complex concepts

### Learning Path

Each topic page follows a consistent structure:

- **Overview** — What you'll learn and why it matters
- **Prerequisites** — What you should know before starting
- **Concept Explanation** — Clear, detailed explanations with examples
- **Syntax & Examples** — Working code you can run and experiment with
- **Common Mistakes** — Learn what to avoid
- **Practice Exercises** — Test your understanding with hands-on problems
- **Next Steps** — What to learn after mastering the topic

### Tips for Success

✅ **Follow the prerequisites** — Don't skip ahead if you're missing foundational knowledge

✅ **Run the code** — Type out examples yourself instead of just reading them

✅ **Do the exercises** — Active practice is key to mastery

✅ **Take notes** — Summarize concepts in your own words

✅ **Build projects** — Apply what you learn to real-world problems
